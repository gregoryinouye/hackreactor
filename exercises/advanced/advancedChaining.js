/**
 * Your task is to write a function that uses a deep learning
 * algorithm to determine the common set of concepts between
 * multiple github profile pictures
 *
 * Given an array of github handles, searchCommonConceptsFromGitHubProfiles should:
 *   1) get the public profile associated with each handle
 *   2) extract the avatar_url of each profile
 *   4) get the set of concepts for each avatar_url (requires API key)
 *   5) find the intersection of the concepts
 *
 * Much of the heavy lifting has been done already in `lib/advancedChainingHelpers`,
 * you just have to wire everything up together! Once you pass this one, you'll
 * be a promise chaining master! Have fun!
